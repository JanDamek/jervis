# Parallel Indexing Implementation Test

## Summary of Changes

The IndexingService has been enhanced to support parallel execution of three indexing operations:

1. **CODE Vector Store Indexing** - Processes files and stores code embeddings using `ModelType.EMBEDDING_CODE`
2. **TEXT Vector Store Indexing** - Processes files for semantic search, splits content into sentences, and stores text
   embeddings using `ModelType.EMBEDDING_TEXT`
3. **Joern Analysis** - Performs comprehensive code analysis and stores results in `.joern` directory within the project

## Key Features Implemented

### Parallel Execution

- All three operations run concurrently using Kotlin coroutines (`async`/`await`)
- Proper error handling and isolation between operations
- Comprehensive logging of results from all operations

### Joern Integration

- Creates `.joern` directory in project root for storing analysis results
- Performs multiple analysis operations: analyze, scan, cpg-info
- Stores results as JSON files with descriptive names
- Creates analysis summary with metadata and file listings
- Graceful handling when Joern is not available

### Vector Store Integration

- CODE embeddings stored in SEMANTIC_CODE_COLLECTION
- TEXT embeddings stored in SEMANTIC_TEXT_COLLECTION
- Proper RagDocument creation with metadata (project, file path, etc.)
- Sentence-level text indexing for better semantic search

### Enhanced Architecture

- Maintains compatibility with existing project indexing rules
- Supports file filtering based on include/exclude globs and size limits
- Uses proper coroutine contexts and dispatchers
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated methods for each operation

## Testing the Implementation

To test the parallel indexing:

1. Ensure Joern is installed and accessible in PATH (optional - will skip gracefully if not available)
2. Configure a project with proper indexing rules in the system
3. Call `indexingService.indexProject(project)`
4. Verify:
    - CODE embeddings are stored in vector database
    - TEXT embeddings are stored in vector database
    - `.joern` directory is created in project root with analysis files
    - All operations complete in parallel with proper logging

## Benefits

- **Performance**: All three operations run in parallel instead of sequentially
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Projects get complete analysis coverage (code, semantic, security)
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with separated concerns
- **Reliability**: Proper error handling and graceful degradation
- **Observability**: Detailed logging of all operations and results

The implementation fulfills all requirements from the issue description:

- ✅ Parallel Joern analysis during indexing
- ✅ CODE vector store indexing
- ✅ TEXT vector store indexing (semantic/sentence)
- ✅ Results stored in `.joern` directory within project
